Wizardry
========

Wizardry is a project that I've been working on for a while now (not downloadable yet) that adds a mystical feel to Minecraft. To start, after installing the mod, you must explore the world to find some materials to create "Orbs of Essence" and create all the elemental type of those. Then you combine them together to create "Condensed Magic". Condensed Magic is used for many things, it manifests magic on most things it touches, but beware, it has a power restriction (you can only use it so many times). After creating the Magic you must choose one or a few paths to take and create those Orbs. Then you can create the Arcane version of most of the ores in the game. Then using them you can eventually create a structure out of Arcane Machines in which the "Power Matrix" is in the center.

For more information, you can visit an official wiki I am working on for the mod [here](http://wizardry-mod-wiki.com).
